# Tic-Tac-Toe Android Game

## Project Description

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is an Android-based application that allows users to play both single-player and multiplayer games. In single-player mode, users can challenge the AI at three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The AI uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging experience in higher difficulties.

In multiplayer mode, the app allows two players to connect over Bluetooth to play against each other. The game is designed with a simple, user-friendly interface that dynamically updates the board as players make moves. Additionally, game history is stored locally using SQLite, allowing users to view past games and track their performance.

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Connect two Android devices via Bluetooth and play against a friend.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI in Hard mode never loses, making optimal moves using alpha-beta pruning.
- **Local Storage**: Past game results, including winner and difficulty level, are saved and can be viewed later.
